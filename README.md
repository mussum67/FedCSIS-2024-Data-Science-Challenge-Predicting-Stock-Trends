# FedCSIS 2024 Data Science Challenge - Stock Trend Prediction

## Overview

This repository hosts the code and analysis for the FedCSIS 2024 Data Science Challenge, centered on predicting stock trends using a diverse set of financial indicators. The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model development to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Key Steps

- **Library Import**: Uses `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `missingno`, `scikit-learn`, `bokeh`, `holoviews`, and `hvplot` for data handling, visualization, and machine learning.
  
- **Data Loading**: Loads training and test datasets, adjusts floating point formats, and maps group codes to sector names.

- **Preprocessing**: Handles missing values by replacing non-applicable or empty strings with zeros.

- **Missing Data Analysis**: Analyzes and visualizes missing data patterns and correlations using `missingno`.

- **Correlation & EDA**: Evaluates correlations between financial indicators and the target variable, and performs exploratory analysis to uncover relationships and patterns across sectors.

## Conclusion

This project aims to leverage statistical learning and data mining techniques to predict stock trends effectively. The comprehensive approach, including thorough data preprocessing and exploratory analysis, lays the foundation for building robust prediction models.
